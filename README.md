# Welcome to Upword Spiral

This mobile application promotes mindfulness and support for people with hurts, habits and hangups who are on the road to recovery.

I began building Upword Spiral in November 2021 as my final project for Flatiron School, an online bootcamp where I received a certificate in Full-stack Software Engineering.

The frontend of this app is written in React Native (this repository) and the backend uses Ruby on Rails (a repository called upword-spiral-backend).
